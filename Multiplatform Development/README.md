# Multiplatform Development

A talk I gave at the September Melbourne UE4 meetup, unfortunately there is no video/audio to go with it but I have tried to annotate areas I felt needed annotations.

Additionally have added an example of a class (PerPlatformWidgetSlot) using both PerPlatform variables and NeedsLoadForTargetPlatform function. This class is a perfect way to encapsulate options menu widgets within a per platform context. Meaning the options won't even appear on platforms that are specified by you!

As per the root ReadMe, if you have any issues with any the topics discussed OR want more explanation please feel free to add an issue and I'll see what I can do!
